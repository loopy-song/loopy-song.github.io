## Yuanming SONG (宋苑铭)

I'm a senior year undergraduate at [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), and I'll obtain my B.S. in computer science in July 2021. Currently I'm working with Prof. [Ding Wang](https://wangdingg.weebly.com/) on password security. I'm also trying to learn more about security, privacy, applied cryptography, and many other CS-related topics.
